Overview

This OpenDXL service provides the DXL fabric with critical, real-time alerts from Vormetric when unauthorized access attempts are made to sensitive data. These alerts indicate that some unintended data access is happening, either from an unauthorized party, roague application, or bad actor. 

Our intent is that other applications and technologies could benefit from this information, and take much needed remediation to prevent further unintended behavior.
